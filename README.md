## Synopsis

heartbeat is a minimalist Java framework for single-board computers (C.H.I.P., Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, etc.)

**SBC** = Single-Board Computer

## Code Example

>TODO: An example of HeartbeatApplication

[CheatSheet](./CheatSheet.md)

##Motivation

**SBCs**  are different from traditional computers and need different best practices.  Google developed **Android APIs** with this motivation.
After some programming experience with SBCs, we decided to create a **framework** to solve common development problems by aiding **developers** with **best practices** and **minimalist libraries**.

## Installation

>TODO: Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.
